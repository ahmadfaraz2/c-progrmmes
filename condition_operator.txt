The general syntax for conditional operator is as follows:
   
>>    condition ? expr1 : expr2


Description:
	If (condition) is true, the conditional operator evaluates to (expr1)
	otherwise, it evaluates to (expr2).

For Example:
	int max = (b > a) ? b : a;
	int min = (b < a) ? b : a;


You cannot, for example, do the following:
	(x > y) ? cout << "x is greater than y." : cout << "x isn't greater than y; //error

	Keep in mind that (expr1) and (expr2) are expressions and not statements.
